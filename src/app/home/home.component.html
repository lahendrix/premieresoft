      <p>Bro. Deckard is a born again Jew that G-d has called to the office of the Prophet. He has established over 160
        churches around the world.  G-d called him to be a Prophet sent to the nations and Bro. Deckard has prophesied
        to leaders and nations throughout the world. A few of the Prophesies that G-d gave to Bro. Deckard which have
        come to pass are as follows:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Prophesied the coming the AIDs Epidemic&nbsp;2 years before it was discovered. He told the
          people that the government would try to cover it up but in the end they would
          have to reveal it.
        </li>
        <li>
          Prophesied

        </li>
        <li>
          Prophesied
          that the cold war would end and the Berlin Wall would be no more, 1
          year before it took place. He also Prophesied that the threat during the cold
          war was not Russia;
          it would come from the Middle East.&nbsp;
        </li>
        <li>
          Prophesied
          that the
          tornado activity in America would become greater than ever before known on
          record.</li>
        <li>
          Prophesied
          that old diseases



          that the world thought had been eradicated

          would return and
          that they would become immune to our modern day medicines now being used.&nbsp;</li>
        <li>
          Prophesied the
          flooding of the great Mississippi River 6 months before
          it occurred.</li>
        <li>
          Prophesied the
          coming of the first war with Iraq
          [Desert Storm], and then prophesied that
          America would have to go back and finish the
          job at a later date.</li>
        <li>
          Prophesied the
          beginning of the European Common Market and the struggle that they would have
          accomplishing the task.</li>

        <li>
          Prophesied
          that the Islamic religion would become the fastest growing religion in the
          United States. This was in 1990, and today it

      <p>This nation has become a stench in the nostrils of G-d and it is too late to turn His judgment back.
        G-dâ€™s spirit will no longer strive with America and America is in for a long, hard fall.
        I realize this is not what people want to hear, but this is what the L-rd is saying.
      </p>
      <p style="font-style: italic; color: indianred;">
        America, prepare thyself to receive the judgments of your G-d. I gave thee of the fatness of the land and put
        strength within thee to overcome nations and kingdoms. But you now think that it was something that you have
        done within yourselves to have accomplished these things. Woe unto you and your mighty men of valor. For I the
        L-rd G-d shall bring to nought your strength and ability to overcome. It is I the L-rd G-d that does bring forth
        kings and nations and it is I that tears them down.
      </p>
      <p style="font-style: italic; color: indianred;">
        You have become an abomination to me. Your priests and seers
        are as sleeping dogs that have refused to repent and seek me with a whole heart. They minister for their own gain.
        I the L-rd G-d will bring them to nought and turn them over to believe a lie. I will cause the storms, earthquakes,
        and floods to become stronger and more frequent. I will send a sword through the land and will cause families to be
        at odds one to another, killing and being killed. Tumult will be throughout the land and your streets will run with
        blood. </p>
      <p style="font-style: italic; color: indianred;">Famine will I send in the land and you will watch as your children die from hunger. I tried over and over
        again to reason with you oâ€™ nation, but you would have me not. We will now see as you have thought to have become
        your own god if you can deliver these people in their time of trouble. I will laugh at you and call you a foolish
        nation. You have forsaken the Living G-d and I have now forsaken you. You will know in the end that I am the G-d
        of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. I was in the beginning and so shall I be in the end.
      </p>
      <p>These are not things that are going to take place overnight. It will transpire very slowly as it already has;
        seemingly as though there has been nothing take place. This nation has become accustomed to all the storms,
        earthquakes, fires, floods, and everything else that the L-rd has sent to try to get the attention of the
        church and this nation.
      </p>
      <p>
        The days that lie ahead for the United States and the world are going to become very trying times.
        The church is slipping deeper and deeper into a coma from which only a remnant will awaken. It is this remnant
        that will do the great exploits in these last days.
      </p>
      <p>We must keep the faith and not be drawn into the snare that is now set for all mankind.</p>
